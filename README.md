## My client is myself, I am an eyelash extension technician. 

## Reflection:
### One technical issue I had encountered was to get the 'section' text to move to the center of the page. By default, it was lined up to the left side, but then I realized I was using px unit rather than the ch unit after the value that I placed for max-width. Once I changed it, it worked the way I had originally wanted it to.
